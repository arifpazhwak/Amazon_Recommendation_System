    "# **Project: Amazon Product Recommendation System**\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this project on Recommendation Systems! We will be working with the Amazon product reviews dataset, which contains ratings for various electronic products. To maintain an unbiased approach in model building, the dataset excludes detailed product information or review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was developed as a part of my coursework for the **MIT Data Science and Machine Learning Program**. While the problem and dataset may be common in educational settings, and other versions or solutions might exist online, this particular notebook, its analysis, and code implementation were completed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **Context:**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, information is growing exponentially with volume, velocity, and variety throughout the globe. This has led to information overload and too many choices for the consumer of any business. It represents a real dilemma for these consumers, who often turn to denial. Recommender Systems are one of the best tools that help in recommending products to consumers while they are Browse online. Providing personalized recommendations that are most relevant for the user is what's most likely to keep them engaged and help businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target, and Etsy use different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. These companies spend millions of dollars to come up with algorithmic techniques that can provide personalized recommendations to their users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon, for example, is well-known for its accurate selection of recommendations on its online site. Amazon's recommendation system is capable of intelligently analyzing and predicting customers' shopping preferences to offer them a list of recommended products. Amazon's recommendation algorithm is therefore a key element in using AI to improve the personalization of its website. For example, one of the baseline recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **Objective:**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, tasked with building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **Dataset:**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id\n",
    "- **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user\n",

    "# 5.2. Model 2: Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is Collaborative Filtering?**\n",
    "    Collaborative Filtering (CF) techniques build models based solely on **past interactions between users and items**. The core idea is \"collaborative\" – it leverages the collective behavior of users (\"wisdom of the crowd\") to make recommendations. Unlike content-based systems, CF doesn't require information about the items themselves (like genre, brand) or about the users (like age, gender). It finds patterns in the user-item interaction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Examples of User-Item Interaction Data for CF:**\n",
    "    * **Explicit Feedback**:\n",
    "        * **Ratings**: Users explicitly rate items (e.g., 1-5 stars for movies on Netflix, products on Amazon). This is what we have in our dataset.\n",
    "    * **Implicit Feedback**:\n",
    "        * **Purchase History**: A user bought a product.\n",
    "        * **Viewing History**: A user watched a video or read an article.\n",
    "        * **Clicks**: A user clicked on a link or an item.\n",
    "        * **Likes/Shares**: A user liked a post or shared content.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering is broadly categorized into two main types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Memory-Based (or Neighborhood-Based/Similarity-Based) CF**:\n",
    "    * These methods use the entire user-item interaction database to calculate similarities between users or items and make recommendations.\n",
    "    * **User-User Collaborative Filtering (User-Based CF)**:\n",
    "        * **Idea**: Find users who are similar to the target user (based on their past rating patterns).\n",
    "        * **Recommendation**: Recommend items that these similar users liked and the target user hasn't yet interacted with.\n",
    "        * *\"Users who are similar to you also liked...\"*\n",
    "    * **Item-Item Collaborative Filtering (Item-Based CF)**:\n",
    "        * **Idea**: Find items that are similar to the items the target user has liked in the past.\n",
    "        * **Recommendation**: Recommend these similar items.\n",
    "        * *\"Users who liked this item also liked...\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Model-Based CF**:\n",
    "    * These methods build a **model** from the user-item interactions to predict ratings for unrated items.\n",
    "    * The model tries to learn latent features (underlying characteristics) of users and items from the interaction data.\n",
    "    * Techniques include **matrix factorization** (like SVD, PMF), clustering, and deep learning approaches.\n",
    "    * These models often scale better to large datasets and can handle sparsity more effectively than memory-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our next step, as a common starting point in CF, we'll explore **User-User Similarity-Based CF**. We'll be using a fantastic Python library called **`Surprise`**, which is specifically designed for building and evaluating recommendation systems. It simplifies many common tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Terminologies for Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build models with `Surprise`, let's define some important terms used for evaluating recommendation systems, especially for top-N recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relevant Item**: An item is considered **relevant** to a user if the user's **actual rating** for that item is above a predefined threshold (e.g., ratings > 3.5 or > 4 on a 1-5 scale). If the actual rating is below this threshold, it's considered non-relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recommended Item**: An item is considered **recommended** if the model's **predicted rating** for that item (for a specific user) is above a predefined threshold. If the predicted rating is below this threshold, the item is not recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **True Positive (TP)**: A relevant item that was correctly recommended.\n",
    "* **False Positive (FP)**: An item that was recommended but is actually not relevant (user rated it low or wouldn't like it). This leads to irrelevant suggestions.\n",
    "* **False Negative (FN)**: A relevant item that was *not* recommended. This represents a missed opportunity to suggest something the user would have liked.\n",
    "* **True Negative (TN)**: A non-relevant item that was correctly not recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these, we derive several common metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Precision**: Out of all the items recommended, what **fraction were actually relevant**?\n",
    "    $$\\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$\n",
    "    High precision means the system makes very few irrelevant recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recall**: Out of all the items that were actually relevant, what **fraction did the system recommend**?\n",
    "    $$\\text{Recall} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$\n",
    "    High recall means the system finds most of the relevant items for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Top-N Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, users are presented with a short list of top N recommendations (e.g., top 5 or top 10). So, we evaluate performance on this specific list:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Precision@k**: The proportion of recommended items in the **top-k set** that are actually relevant.\n",
    "    * Example: If we recommend 5 items (k=5) and 3 of them are relevant, Precision@5 = 3/5 = 0.6.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recall@k**: The proportion of all relevant items (that the user would have liked) that are found in the **top-k recommendations**.\n",
    "    * Example: If the user has 10 relevant items in total, and our top-5 recommendations include 3 of them, Recall@5 = 3/10 = 0.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **F1-score@k**: The **harmonic mean** of Precision@k and Recall@k. It provides a single score that balances both precision and recall. It's particularly useful when both metrics are important.\n",
    "    $$\\text{F1-score@k} = 2 \\times \\frac{\\text{Precision@k} \\times \\text{Recall@k}}{\\text{Precision@k} + \\text{Recall@k}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These metrics help us understand how good our recommendation system is at suggesting items that users will find useful and engaging. We'll be using some of these (or RMSE/MAE for rating prediction) when we evaluate our `Surprise`-based models."

    "## 5.2.1.7. Hyperparameter Tuning for User-User CF Model\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why this step?** Most machine learning models, including our User-User Collaborative Filtering model (`KNNBasic`), have parameters that are not learned from the data directly but are set before the training process begins. These are called **hyperparameters** (e.g., the number of neighbors `k`, the similarity measure). Hyperparameter tuning is the process of finding the combination of these hyperparameters that results in the best performance for our specific dataset and task. This can lead to a more accurate and effective recommendation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the `GridSearchCV` utility from the `Surprise` library. It systematically works through multiple combinations of parameter tunes, cross-validates each, and determines which combination of parameters gives the best performance on a chosen metric (like RMSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Key `KNNBasic` Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we define our grid for tuning, let's understand some of the main hyperparameters for the `KNNBasic` algorithm in `Surprise`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`k`** (int): This specifies the maximum number of neighbors to consider when making a prediction. For example, if `k=40`, the algorithm will find the 40 most similar users (or items) to help predict a rating. The default value in `Surprise` is 40.\n",
    "* **`min_k`** (int): This sets the minimum number of neighbors required to make a prediction. If fewer than `min_k` neighbors are found, the prediction defaults to the global average of all ratings in the training set. The default value is 1.\n",
    "* **`sim_options`** (dict): This is a dictionary that configures the similarity measure used to find neighbors. Key options within `sim_options` include:\n",
    "    * **`'name'`** (str): Defines the similarity metric. Common choices include:\n",
    "        * `'cosine'`: Computes the cosine similarity between user/item vectors.\n",
    "        * `'msd'`: Computes the Mean Squared Difference similarity. This is the **default** similarity measure for `KNNBasic` if no `sim_options` are provided or if `'name'` isn't specified.\n",
    "        * `'pearson'`: Computes the Pearson correlation coefficient.\n",
    "        * `'pearson_baseline'`: Computes the Pearson correlation coefficient, but takes into account baseline ratings (global mean + user bias + item bias). This often performs better than simple Pearson.\n",
    "    * **`'user_based'`** (bool): When `True`, it computes user-user similarity. When `False`, it computes item-item similarity. Default is `True`.\n",
    "    * **`'min_support'`** (int): The minimum number of common items (for user-based similarity) or common users (for item-based similarity) required between two entities for their similarity to be considered. This is particularly relevant for similarity measures like Pearson correlation to avoid spurious correlations based on too few common points. Default is 1.\n",
    "    * **`'shrinkage'`** (int): A shrinkage parameter used only with the `'pearson_baseline'` similarity. It helps to regularize similarity scores. Default is 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these parameters will help us make informed choices when we set up the `param_grid` for `GridSearchCV`. Now, we can proceed with defining that grid and running the tuning process."

This strongly suggests that for these specific unrated items for this particular user, the tuned Item-Item model was unable to find sufficiently strong item-similarity signals to make highly differentiated, personalized predictions and likely resorted to a default or global mean-like estimate.\n",

    "* **What is Model-Based Collaborative Filtering?** Model-based Collaborative Filtering is a personalized recommendation system where recommendations are based on the past behavior of the user. Like other CF approaches, it is not dependent on any additional explicit information about users or items beyond their interactions. A key characteristic is that these methods learn underlying patterns or **latent features** from the user-item interaction data to make predictions and find recommendations for each user.\n",

    "* **What is SVD in this context?** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a well-known matrix factorization technique. In the context of recommendation systems, the idea is to decompose the (often very sparse) user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices representing latent features of users and items. The product of these latent feature matrices can then be used to predict ratings for user-item pairs, including those with missing values.\n",
    "* **Addressing Missing Values**: Traditional, \"pure\" SVD (as used in linear algebra) requires a complete matrix and doesn't directly handle missing values. However, the SVD algorithms used in recommendation systems (like the one in the `Surprise` library) are specifically adapted for this sparse data scenario. They typically use techniques like gradient descent or alternating least squares to learn the latent factor matrices by only considering the known ratings, effectively \"ignoring\" the missing ones during the factorization process. So, while the name \"SVD\" is used, it's more accurately a matrix factorization algorithm inspired by SVD, optimized for implicit feedback or sparse explicit feedback datasets.\n",

Its ability to generalize (as matrix factorization models often do) likely contributes to its strong performance.\n",

    "**Therefore, the recommended model for Amazon to help recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings would be the Tuned SVD model with parameters: `n_epochs=30`, `lr_all=0.005`, `reg_all=0.04`.**\n",

    "## 6.4. Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Sparsity**: Although we filtered the data, recommendation datasets are often sparse. This can still pose challenges for models, as seen in some specific prediction cases where KNN models defaulted.\n",
    "* **Cold Start**: The collaborative filtering models explored (KNN and SVD) will struggle with new users or new items that have no interaction history (the \"cold start\" problem).\n",
    "* **Scalability**: For extremely large datasets like Amazon's full catalog, the scalability of training and prediction for some models (especially KNN's similarity matrix computation) would need careful consideration. SVD is generally more scalable.\n",
    "* **Evaluation Metrics**: While RMSE, Precision@k, and Recall@k are standard, other metrics like coverage, diversity, and serendipity could also be important depending on business goals.\n",
    "* **Implicit Feedback**: We only used explicit ratings. Incorporating implicit feedback (views, clicks, purchase history) could enhance recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Future Work could include**:\n",
    "    * Exploring Hybrid Models: Combining collaborative filtering with content-based approaches (using product metadata) could address cold-start issues and improve recommendations.\n",
    "    * Advanced Matrix Factorization Techniques: Trying other MF algorithms like SVD++ (which incorporates implicit feedback) or NMF.\n",
    "    * Deep Learning Approaches: Exploring neural network-based recommendation models.\n",
    "    * More Extensive Hyperparameter Tuning: Using larger search spaces or more sophisticated tuning algorithms for `GridSearchCV`.\n",
    "    * Online Evaluation: Implementing A/B testing to evaluate models in a live environment.\n",
    "    * Context-Aware Recommendations: Incorporating contextual information (e.g., time, location, device) if available."
